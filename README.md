While on a short flight (ATL to CMH) a devolper friend and mentor of mine challenged me to recreate the front page of the Southwest saftey flyer. I managed to complete about 70% of the page before I had to put my laptop away. I completed the remainter of the CSS a couple days later. It was a fun challege to work on my HTML and CSS skills.
